# About Me
Hey! I am Krishna. I am an undergraduate student at IT engineering department with keen interest in designing beautiful systems internally and externally. 
Like to build end to end software products on web. (from idea to deployment and maintainance).
In free time I generally contribute to open source or make projects on new technologies.

Some ideas that i believe and working on:
-  In all Life, when a thing works better, **usually it is more beautiful to the eye**.
- True beauty is built equally on the **inside and the outside.**  (Yeah! this idea is borrowed from Steve Jobs)
- Instincts matters more than logic.
- Stay around with great ideas, and your results will reflect that greatness.
- The direction where you are going is directly dependent on dopamine incentives.
- It's much easier on things that i am passionate about. So make intersection of those.
- You can do more than you think. Don't underestimate yourself.
- Every opportunity well handed leads to more. (People listening to founder's podcast can relate)

Writing down the ideas I follow is harder than I expected, and this list may change depending on the situations.
