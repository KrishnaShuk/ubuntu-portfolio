# About This Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio!
This portfolio is my attempt at building a pixel-perfect UI inspired by my Ubuntu system. I’m trying to make it look and feel as close as possible to my actual desktop. It took me several hours to create, and the journey of building it was both challenging and fun, absolutely loved the process!

There’s still a lot of room for improvement, and I’m planning to make this project open source so that others can use it, contribute, and help it grow.
